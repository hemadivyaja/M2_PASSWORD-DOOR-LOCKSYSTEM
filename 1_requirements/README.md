This project “Atmega328 based password protected locking system” can be used to
provide enough security in various places like bank lockers, security doors,
BIOS locking in computer etc.
Password Based Door Lock System is designed using atmega328 where
in once the correct code or password is entered, the door is opened and the
concerned person is allowed access to the secured area. Password Based Door
Lock System using atmega is a simple project where a secure password
will act as a door unlocking system. Old fashioned lock systems use mechanical
locking and these can be replaced by new advanced techniques of locking
systems. These methods are a combination of mechanical and electronic devices
and are highly intelligent. One of the distinct features of these intelligent lock
systems is their simplicity and high efficiency. Such an automated lock system
consists of electronic control assembly, which controls the output load through a
password. The example of this output load can be a motor or a lamp or any
other mechanical/electrical load. Here, we made an electronic code lock system
using Arduino UNO, which provides control to the actuating the load. It is a
simple embedded system with takes input from the keyboard and the output
being actuated accordingly. This system demonstrates a Password based Door
Lock. System using Arduino UNO, wherein once the correct code or password
is entered, the door is opened and the concerned person is allowed access to the
secured area. If another person arrives, it will ask to enter the password again. If
the password is wrong, then door would remain locked, denying access to the
person. Main idea behind this project is of a door-latch opening using a
password entered through keypad. As well as turning on the Buzzer when
passcode is entered wrong for multiple times. User can modify this password
anytime he/she wishes using a keypad. The main component in the circuit is
Arduino UNO which is basically used to send a text message to owner of the
house about the breach of security.4*4 keypad is used to enter the password.
The entered password is compared with the known password. If it is correct
password, the system opens the door by servo motor and displays the status of
door on LCD. If the password is wrong then door remains closed and displays
“WRONG PASSWORD” on LCD.
